## Java

There are the same 5 sorting algorithms and 5 algorithms to solve sudoku:

* Sort
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Fusion Sort
    * Quick Sort

* Sudoku
    * Backtracking
    * Dancing Links
    * Graph coloting with dancing links
    * Graph coloring with backtracking
    * Graph coloring with parallel backtracking
